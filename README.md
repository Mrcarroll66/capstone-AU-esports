### Purpose:
The idea was to create a un updated website for Anderson University Esports, Including recent highlights, schedules, news, and more.


### Progress:
We started out with an initial UI mock-up and a diagram/map for the webiste layout, also created basic user stories we could build off. Next we were heavliy trying to get the database connected and working in sync with the project. 


During the process, we were taking a slower approach, as we were still waiting to hear back from MARCOMM. 

After they eventually responded, it looks as if we can't continue with this right now.
